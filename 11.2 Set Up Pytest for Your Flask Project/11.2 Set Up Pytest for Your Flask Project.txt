-> Introduction  
   -> In this lesson, you will learn how to use Python pytest to write unit tests for your Flask app  
   -> This will be a mini crash course that covers the basics of getting started with pytest and testing a Flask application  
   -> By the end of the lesson, you should be able to set up and write basic tests for your app  

-> What Is Python Pytest?  
   -> Pytest is a powerful testing framework for Python, primarily used for writing unit tests  
   -> What makes Pytest special is that it is simple to use, highly extensible, and requires minimal boilerplate code  
   -> Pytest allows you to write tests that are both expressive and readable, even for beginners  
   -> It can be used to write small unit tests or more complex functional tests for your applications or libraries  

-> Test Discovery  
   -> Pytest is designed to make testing easy by automatically discovering test files and test functions  
   -> By default, it looks for files that start with `test_` (e.g., `test_app.py`)  
   -> It then looks inside these files for functions that begin with `test_` (e.g., `test_app_creation()`)  
   -> This automatic discovery of tests reduces the need for you to manually specify which tests to run, making the process more efficient  

-> Testing Your Flask App  
   -> The next step is to test your Flask app using pytest. You’ll be writing simple tests to check that your Flask application is working as expected  
   -> In this section, you will create your first test to ensure that your app is being created correctly  

-> First Test  
   -> The first thing you need to do is create a test file. Name it `test_app.py` and place it in your project's root directory  
   -> This test file will import your Flask app and verify that it is created successfully when using the app factory  
   -> A simple test might look like this:  
     ```python  
     from app import create_app  
     def test_app_creation():  
         app = create_app('testing')  
         assert app  
         assert app.config['TESTING']  
     ```  
   -> In this example:  
      -> `create_app('testing')` creates an instance of your Flask app using the 'testing' configuration  
      -> The `assert` statements check that the app is successfully created and that the `TESTING` configuration is enabled  

-> Flask Test Configuration  
   -> Before running your tests, you need to configure your Flask app to use a test database  
   -> Set the `TESTING` configuration variable to `True` to enable testing mode in Flask  
   -> Also, ensure that your app uses a different database URL (e.g., `data-test.sqlite`) for testing purposes, so as not to interfere with your production database  

-> Additional App Creation Test  
   -> In addition to testing the app creation, it’s important to test the availability of the `current_app` after the app context has been pushed  
   -> You can also check whether the `TESTING` configuration has been set correctly in the app  
   -> Example code:  
     ```python  
     from flask import current_app  
     def test_current_app():  
         app = create_app('testing')  
         app.app_context().push()  
         assert current_app  
         assert current_app.config['TESTING']  
     ```  
   -> In this test:  
      -> The `current_app` is checked to make sure it refers to the app instance you just created  
      -> You confirm that the `TESTING` configuration is still set to `True`  

-> Database Insertion Test  
   -> Once your app and configuration tests are passing, you can move on to more complex tests, such as testing database operations  
   -> In this test, you'll verify that the correct test database is being used and perform a simple insertion into the database  
   -> Example code:  
     ```python  
     from app import db  
     from app.models import User  
     def test_database_insert():  
         app = create_app('testing')  
         assert app.config['TESTING']  
         assert 'data-test.sqlite' in app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']  
         app.app_context().push()  
         db.create_all()  
         u = User(email='john@example.com', username='john')  
         db.session.add(u)  
         db.session.commit()  
         db.session.remove()  
         db.drop_all()  
     ```  
   -> In this example:  
      -> The test checks if the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` is correctly pointing to the test database (`data-test.sqlite`)  
      -> It creates the necessary tables in the test database, adds a user to the `User` model, commits the transaction, and then cleans up by dropping the tables  
      -> The important part is cleaning up the database after the test (`db.session.remove()` and `db.drop_all()`) so that it remains in a known state for subsequent tests  

-> Getting Organised  
   -> As you write more tests, you'll find that your test code can become repetitive and hard to maintain  
   -> To avoid duplicating code and to keep things organised, you can group tests by type (e.g., unit tests, functional tests) into separate directories  
   -> You can also use **fixtures** (covered in a later lesson) to create reusable pieces of setup code that can be shared between tests  
   -> It's a good idea to keep your test files organised to make them easier to manage as your app grows  

-> Test Setup  
   -> Here's an example of how your project directory structure might look, including your `tests/` folder for tests:  
     ```
     app/
     └── ...  
     migrations/
     └── ...  
     tests/
     ├── conftest.py  
     ├── test_app.py  
     └── ...  
     ```  
   -> The `tests/` folder holds all of your unit tests  
   -> `conftest.py` is a configuration file that is useful when you want to set up common test fixtures that can be shared across multiple test files  

-> Starting Your Tests  
   -> Once you have organised your test files, you'll need to tell pytest where to find them  
   -> You can do this by running pytest from the command line with the following command:  
     ```
     python -m pytest tests/
     ```  
   -> This will instruct pytest to look in the `tests/` folder for any files that match the test discovery rules  

-> VS Code Launch Configuration  
   -> If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can streamline your testing workflow by adding a launch configuration for pytest  
   -> Example configuration in VS Code:  
     ```json  
     {  
         "name": "Python: Test All",  
         "type": "python",  
         "request": "launch",  
         "module": "pytest",  
         "env": {  
             "DATABASE_TEST_URL": "sqlite:///${workspaceFolder}/data-test.sqlite",  
             "PYTHONPATH": ". tests"  
         },  
         "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/tests/", "--show-capture=stdout"]  
     }  
     ```  
   -> This configuration allows you to run your tests directly from VSCode, and it also ensures that the test database is correctly set up  

-> Summary: Python Pytest  
   -> In this lesson, you’ve successfully learned how to set up and use Python pytest with Flask  
   -> You’ve:  
      -> Used Pytest for unit testing  
      -> Understood test discovery, where pytest automatically identifies test files and functions based on naming conventions  
      -> Written your first Flask test to check if the app is created successfully  
      -> Tested database interactions by verifying that data is inserted correctly and cleaned up after tests  
      -> Organised your tests and set up a VS Code launch configuration for streamlined testing  
   -> With this foundation, you are now ready to expand your testing knowledge by learning about fixtures and more advanced testing strategies in the next lessons
